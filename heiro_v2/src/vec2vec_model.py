Vec2Vec Model Implementation for Hieroglyphic-English Translation

This module implements the neural vec2vec model for mapping between
hieroglyphic and English embedding spaces without supervised translation pairs.

Original file size: 15,609 bytes
Compiled: 2025-07-15

NOTE: This is a stub file. The original source code was compiled to Python 3.12 bytecode
which cannot be decompiled with current tools. The implementation followed the vec2vec
architecture described in the project README.

Key components that were implemented:
- Vec2VecModel class with encoder/decoder architecture
- Shared latent space (256 dimensions)
- Loss functions: reconstruction + cycle consistency + latent alignment
- Training loop with adaptive learning rate
